Approach 1:

def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5):
    print(i, end=' : ')
Description:

This code establishes a function named doubleL, taking a parameter n. Inside the function, an empty list called res is initialized. The function then iterates over the range from 0 to n-1, doubling each element and appending the result to the list res. The function concludes by returning the populated list res. In the subsequent for loop, doubleL(5) is invoked, and it iterates through the obtained list, printing each element followed by ' : '.

Approach 2:

for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
Description:

In this code, a list comprehension is employed to generate the list [n * 2 for n in range(5)]. The iteration spans the range from 0 to 4 (created by range(5)), doubling each element and forming the resulting list as [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]. Subsequently, a for loop navigates through this list, printing each element followed by ' : '.


Approach 3:

def doubleG(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
    print(i, end=' : ')


This program introduces a generator function named doubleG, which accepts a parameter n. Within the function, the yield keyword is utilized to produce the result of i * 2 for each i in the range from 0 to n-1. The final for loop calls doubleG(5) and traverses through the values yielded by the generator, printing each value followed by ' : '.

Function Type for doubleG(n):
doubleG(n) is classified as a generator function. It employs the yield keyword to generate a sequence of values one at a time, enabling the caller to iterate through the values without having to generate the entire sequence all at once.

Advantage of Using a Generator Function:
The significant advantage of opting for a generator function like doubleG is its support for lazy evaluation. Rather than creating and storing the complete list of values in memory, a generator generates values on-the-fly. This not only conserves memory but also enhances efficiency, especially when handling extensive datasets. Generators are particularly advantageous when the focus is on iterating over the sequence without the need to store the entire sequence in memory simultaneously.
